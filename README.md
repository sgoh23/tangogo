# tangogo
Tangogo is a project to help small, medium, businesses to digitalise manual processes and enable better use to personnel effort. 
The first few features are centered around reconciliation between bank statement and the company's cash account in their books. 

This is a newbie coder trying to practice domain driven design, TDD, BDD and clean coding. 

With this feature, hopefully manual eye-balling effort to match cash transaction records goes away. Mismatches can be "intelligently" flagged to user for further actions.
